# KAD-Utils

## Collection of utility functions from the "KAD-Universe" (https://klaushe.github.io/KAD/)

This utility collection is a es6-module file without dependencies or libraries.\
It contains partly specific functionality for my website and on the other hand general things like color conversions.\

## How to get the Utils in a project

1. Use as stand-alone javascript-module by importing like (recommended):\
   `import * as KadUtils from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/KlausHe/KadUtils/KadUtils.js"`\

2. Use as submodule in git to stay updated with the latest functionality (not recommended because I might upload breaking changes without documentation!)\
   `git submodule add https://github.com/KlausHe/KadUtils.git`\
   `git submodule init`\
   `git submodule update`\
